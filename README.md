# 05-data-visualization-challenge

In this project, we merge and analyze two sets of data pertaining to cancer treatment testing performed on mice. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the relationships between the mouse data and the testing results, with the hope that we can use this analysis to predict which treatments will be successful in the future.

Data Sources:
Mouse Metadata - Contains data about each mouse tested in the study, including sex, age, and weight.
Study Results - Contains results of studies conducted on the mice.

Tools and Resources Used:
Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib - for creating visualizations
Scipy - for statistical analysis

Observations:
1. There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
2. Capomulin shows promising results in reducing tumor volume.
